# TRAINTODAMASCUS - Interactive Fiction
Going steadily at 55km/h with frequent stops.

The man I'm sitting with in a compartment slowly stands up wobbling along with track turbulations and reaches for his grey, heavily-worn sport bag up above him. Beer in his back pocket and he's gone for the next 2 hours.

Two days back and it was a cold cold place back in hometown.

Game with 52 scenes on the railroad map, one for every week of the year. Realtime.
